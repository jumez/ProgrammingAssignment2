## This code takes any square matrix and finds its inverse, so the final
## output, after calling both functions, is another square matrix. both 
## the matrix and its inverse are stored in cache

## makeCacheMatrix takes a square matrix and stores it in chache. 
## the output is a list of functions

        m <- NULL

## cacheSolve takes the square matrix stored in cache by makeCacheMatrix 
## and calculates the inverse of that matrix and stores it in cache as well
